# exchange-rates - simple solution for seeing current currency exchange rates
From the start you only see select pairs of currencies, each with an input that dynamically changes value of the opposite input, so that you can more easily compare end values for any means. You can also add new pairs by pushing a plus icon and filling the form for a new pair.
